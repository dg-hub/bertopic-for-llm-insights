# Large Language Models (LLMs) Impact Analyzer using BERTopic

The Large Language Models Impact Analyzer is a powerful python repository designed to unveil the true potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in your organisation. This repository contains Python scripts that leverage the power of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, particularly BERTopic to analyse user interactions, evaluate LLM adoption, and generate insightful reports allowing your organisation to understand where and how LLMs contribute to its performance.

## Main Features

- Detailed User Interaction: Analyze text-based interactions of your users with your LLMs.
- Identification of Key Themes using BERTopic: Identify General and specific Themes found in your Usersâ€™ interactions.
- Insights Generation: Generate actionable insights based on the obtained topics to optimise the use and adoption of LLMs in your organisation.
- Facilitate LLM Adoption: Monitor the adoption process and facilitate it based on the insights obtained.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
